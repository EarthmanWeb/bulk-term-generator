Streamline taxonomy management in WordPress with Bulk Term Generator, your free tool for easy, bulk term importing.

== Description ==

Are you tired of manually adding terms in WordPress one by one? Do you find CSV import plugins complex and restrictive? Enter Bulk Term Generator - a revolutionary WordPress plugin designed to streamline and simplify your taxonomy management process.

Bulk Term Generator allows you to seamlessly import large volumes of terms to your selected taxonomies in WordPress. Its powerful yet easy-to-use interface lets you copy and paste your terms, queue them up, and even select a parent term for hierarchy. No need for pre-formatted CSV files or meticulous manual entry. You can even specify the slug and description for each term, making your content even more search-friendly.

But the magic doesn’t stop there. Bulk Term Generator gives you total control before you import your terms. With its unique 'Preview' feature, you can see exactly how your terms will be added and make any necessary changes before hitting the final "Generate Terms" button. Plus, you can edit or delete any queued term at any point with just a click.

Bulk Term Generator has been lauded as a 'lifesaver' and a 'developer's dream' by our users, and we are confident you will think the same:
